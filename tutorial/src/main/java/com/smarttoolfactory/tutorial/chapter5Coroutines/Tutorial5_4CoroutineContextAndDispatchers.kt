 * for coroutines which neither consume CPU time nor update any shared data (like UI)
 * confined to a specific thread.
 *
 * * On the other side, the dispatcher is inherited from the outer CoroutineScope by default.
 * The default dispatcher for the runBlocking coroutine, in particular,
 * is confined to the invoker thread, so inheriting it has the effect of confining execution
