Here is the complete list of various character classes constructs:
[abc]: It would match with text if the text is having either one of them(a,b or c) and only once.
[^abc]:  Any single character except a, b, or c (^ denote negation)
[a-zA-Z]:  a through z, or A through Z, inclusive (range)
[a-d[m-p]]:  a through d, or m through p: [a-dm-p] (union)
[a-z&&[def]]:  Any one of them (d, e, or f)
[a-z&&[^bc]]: a through z, except for b and c: [ad-z] (subtraction)
[a-z&&[^m-p]]:  a through z, and not m through p: [a-lq-z] (subtraction)
